    "# PROJECT PART 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Problem and Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "*What's the project about? What problem are you solving?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is about acceptance of basic income and similar concepts in the United States.  It could potentially mitigate the problem of extreme poverty and how to best handle presentations of it in marketing and system design.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Where does this seem to reside as a machine learning problem? Are you predicting some continuous number, or predicting a binary value?*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular problem we are predicting the presence of specific words (binary) for use in a personality description of those who initially can be classified as for or against basic income and other related programs (such as welfare and other social support systems) \n",
    "\n",
    "*What kind of impact do you think it could have?*\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be useful in developing marketing and proposals for systems designed for those who have reservations about proactive poverty control.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What do you think will have the most impact in predicting the value you are interested in solving for?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In searching for certain words I’m making assumptions about language, grammar and spelling.  Some subtleties may go overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "*Description of data set available, at the field level. (see table)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is available on twitter. I’ll be using the tweepy python library through the twitter API to collect data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If from an API, include a sample return. (this is usually included in API documentation!) (if doing this in markdown, use the JavaScript code tag)*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "*What experience do you already have around this area?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve been studying Basic Income and Economics concepts for a long time, I have experience with the cultural hesitancy in the United States and know what kind of vocabulary to look for.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Does it relate or help inform the project in any way?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, because I’ll be using that vocabulary to form my search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What other research efforts exist?*\n",
    "    *Use a quick Google search to see what approaches others have made, or talk with your colleagues if it is work related about previous attempts at similar problems.*\n",
    "    *This could even just be something like \"the marketing team put together a forecast in excel that doesn't do well.\"*\n",
    "    *Include a benchmark, how other models have performed, even if you are unsure what the metric means.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    there's some interesting research on economical beliefs here: http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20ariely%20in%20press.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "*What questions do you have about your project? What are you not sure you quite yet understand? (The more honest you are about this, the easier your instructors can help)*\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m not sure what a healthy sample size would be and when it’s reasonable to stop collecting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*What are the assumptions and caveats to the problem?*\n",
    "    *What data do you not have access to but wish you had?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm making assumptions about language and the types of words that will be used to talk about these subjects.  I wish I had access to a larger quantity of varied thoughts on Basic Income in a more intellectual forum, perhaps with a larger character count.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    *What is already implied about the observations in your data set? For example, if your primary data set is twitter data, it may not be representative of the whole sample. (say, predicting who would win an election)*\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above (and in the question itself) the sampled data is not representative of all of the people that have negative (or positive) interesting thoughts on Basic Income. \n",
    "\n",
    "*What are the risks to the project?*\n",
    "    *What's the cost of your model being wrong? (What's the benefit of your model being right?)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the model is exploratory (the only prediction being that those who disagree with Basic Income have a tendency of being of a certain political leaning) I don’t see any risk to the prediction being ‘wrong’, it will still be useful in deciding how to formulate a marketing response.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Is any of the data incorrect? Could it be incorrect?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I could be wrong about my general prediction of political leanings.  I might not be able to completely control for things like sarcasm to detect what is truly being communicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "*What do you expect the output to look like?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan on formatting the output to be a series of word/term co-occurrence probabilities, to show how likely selected twitter users are to use specific words in conjunction with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What does your target audience expect the output to look like?*\n",
    "\n",
    "My target audience would be interested in knowing the personality and interest profiles of the sample, so I think a word/term co-occurrence probability table would be ideal for them as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What gain do you expect from your most important feature on its own?*\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be interesting to see how many negative vs. positive comments there are on Basic Income and welfare (the primary feature)\n",
    "\n",
    "*How complicated does your model have to be?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from detecting for flaws like sarcasm, the model is fairly simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How successful does your project have to be in order to be considered a \"success\"?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to find some significant personality conclusions from the sample in order to declare the project a “success”\n",
    "\n",
    "*What will you do if the project is a bust (this happens! but it shouldn't here)?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If I truly find no interesting conclusions from this dataset then I might consider other sources for a study of topic/vocabulary co-occurrence, or in the future I might design my own study of the American people and their thoughts on our economy.  Outside of this I plan on doing a parallel of country economies that are currently engaged in Basic Income (but have lower incomes on average) vs the current American economy.  "
